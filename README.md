Download the above files. Create a folder named _iNiLabs_ inside _htdocs_ folder in _xampp_ directory. Finally, copy the _iNiLabs_ folder inside _htdocs_ folder. Now, visit [localhost/iNiLabs](http://localhost/iNiLabs) in your browser and you should see the output for all tasks assigned and visit [localhost/iNiLabs/task5](http://localhost/iNiLabs/task5) in your browser and you should see the project of To-Do-List App of task_5.
